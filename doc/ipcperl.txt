== NAME
ipcperl - preforking ipcserver running embedded Perl

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipcperl !opts! !file! !prog!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 

The +ipcperl+ program forks the requested number of children, each listening
for IPC client connections.  Before handling any requests, each child parses
and runs the perl code in +!file!+.  The file should end with a true
expression, like a module.

To handle a request, a child process executes +!prog!+ as a perl
subroutine with one or more arguments, with file descripto{nbsp}0 reading from
the network and file descripto{nbsp}1 writing to the network.  Before handling
the request, the child sets certain environment variables, a la
link:ipcserver.html[+ipcserver+].

Each invocation of +!prog!+ handles a single request.  It is called within
a loop, with one iteration per request, and therefore must release any
resources allocated to handle a particular request.

If +!prog!+ exits while handling a request, +ipcperl+ will start a new child
process.


=== Configuration
Edit the following files in +src/+ as necessary for your installation.  Unless
you use modules that require +xs+ support or a nonstandard version of perl,
the defaults should suffice.

+ipcperl.c+::
If your server uses a module like +DBI.pm+ you may need to add the requisite
+xs+ code.

+conf-ldperl+::
Determine options required to load +ipcperl+.  By default, these are
calculated automatically.  Using +xs+ code in +src/ipcperl.c+ may require
manual option setting in +src/conf-ldperl+.

+conf-ccperl+::
Determine options required to compile +ipcperl+.  By default, these are
calculated automatically.

+conf-perl+::
How to invoke perl to calculate options automatically in +conf-ccperl+ and
+conf-ldperl+.


== BUGS 

CDB_File::
Iterative lookups succeed but random lookups fail.  Each +ipchandle+ server
uses the original http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html[cdb] library for access control.
The http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/CDB_File-0.92[CDB_File-0.92]
package redefines +cdb_findnext+ without declaring it static.  The linker may
select the wrong definition.  Solution: Add +static+ to the declaration of
+cdb_findnext+ in CDB_File.xs.
