== NAME
ipcserver - run a program or connections on a local domain socket

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipcserver !opts! !path! !prog!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +ipcserver+ program listens for connections from local-domain clients.
For each connection, it runs +!prog!+, with descriptor 0 reading from the
network and descriptor 1 writing to the network.  Before running +!prog!+,
+ipcserver+ sets certain link:ucspi-ipc-environ.html[environment variables].

The +ipcserver+ program exits when it receives SIGTERM.


== OPTIONS
=== General Options:
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.

+-Q+::
Print error messages.  This is the default.

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print error messages and status messages.

=== Connection options:
+-c !n!+::
Do not handle more than +!n!+ simultaneous connections.  If there are +!n!+
simultaneous connections copies of +prog+ running, defer acceptance of a new
connection until one copy finishes.  +!n!+ must be a positive integer.  The
default value is{nbsp}40.

+-x !cdb!+::
Follow the rules compiled into +!cdb!+ by link:ipcrules.html[+ipcrules+].
These rules may specify setting environment variables or rejecting connections
from bad sources.  You can rerun +ipcrules+ to change the rules while
+ipcserver+ is running.

+-X+::
With +-x !cdb!+, allow connections even if +!cdb!+ does not exist.  Normally
+ipcserver+ will drop the connection if +!cdb!+ does not exist.

+-B !banner!+::
Write +!banner!+ to the network immediately after each connection is made.

+-g !gid!+::
Switch group ID to +!gid!+ after preparing to receive connections.  +!gid!+
must be a positive integer.

+-u !uid!+::
Switch user ID to +!uid!+ after preparing to receive connections.  +!uid!+
must be a positive integer.

+-U+::
Same as +-g $GID -u $UID+.  Typically, +$GID+ and +$UID+ are set by
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envuidgid.html[+envuidgid+].

+-b !n!+::
Allow a backlog of approximately +!n!+ pending connections.

+-d+::
Delete +!path!+ before binding it to a socket.  This is the default.

+-D+::
No not delete +!path!+ before binding it to a socket.

=== Data-gathering options:
+-l !localpath!+::
Do not look up the path bound to the local socket; use +!localpath!+ for the
environment variable +$IPCLOCALPATH+.

+-p+::
Look up the peer's effective user and group IDs.  Put the results in the
environment variables +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+.  This is the
default.

+-P+::
Do not look up the peer's effective user and group IDs.  Unset the environment
variables +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+.
