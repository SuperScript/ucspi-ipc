== System requirements
The {package} packageworks only under UNIX.  In addition, {package} requires
an implementation of link:getpeereid.html[+getpeereid+].

This package implements +getpeereid+ for recent Linux kernels.
Some systems offer +gepeereid+ as system call, including
http://www.openbsd.org[OpenBS{nbsp}3.0],
http://www.freebsd.org[FreeBS{nbsp}4.6] and
http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/index.html[AI{nbsp}5L].
Several link:../patches/index.html[patches] are also available to add
a +getpeereid+ system call to older BSD operating system versions.

On systems that lack +getpeereid+, {package} runs, but
link:ipcserver.html[+ipcserver+] generates an error if +getpeereid+ is called,
i.e. when invoked without the +-P+ switch.  The package regression tests fail
on platforms without +getpeereid+.

== Installation
If necessary, create a +/package+ directory:
!!!!
mkdir /package
chmod 1755 /package
cd /package
!!!!

Download the {package} package.  The most recent {package} package is
link:{package}-{version}.tar.gz[{version}].  Unpack {package} in
+/package+:
!!!!
gunzip {package}-{version}.tar
tar -xpf {package}-{version}.tar
rm {package}-{version}.tar
cd {path}/{package}-{version}
!!!!

Compile the package:
!!!!
package/compile
!!!!

Run some tests:
!!!!
package/rts
!!!!
The output should be empty.  Tests will fail on systems that lack
+getpeereid+ support.

Install the package:
!!!!
package/install
!!!!

Commands are installed in the
+/package/host/superscript.com/command+ directory.
For compatibility with prior versions, commands are also installed in
the +/usr/local/bin+ directory.

Report successful installation:
!!!!
package/report
!!!!


== Package subsets
To restrict the compile or install to a subset of the entire package,
supply the name of a subset on the command line:
!!!!
package/compile !subset!
package/rts !subset!
package/install !subset!
!!!!

To exclude a subset from an operation, add a hyphen as the first
command-line argument:
!!!!
package/compile - !subset!
package/rts - !subset!
package/install - !subset!
!!!!

Valid subsets in this package are +base+ and +ipcperl+.

*NB*: Package subset handling will be removed in a future version.
