ipccommand - form an ipc client request

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipccommand !uid! !prog!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +ipccommand+ program is designed to run under
link:ipcclient.html[+ipcclient+].  It converts +!uid!+ and +!prog!+ to
a request appropriate for transmission to link:ipcexec.html[+ipcexec+] and
writes the result to file descripto{nbsp}7.  Thereafter, +ipccommand+ reads
data from file descripto{nbsp}0 and writes it to file descripto{nbsp}7.
Simultaneously, it reads data from file descripto{nbsp}6 and writes it to file
descripto{nbsp}1.

== EXIT STATUS 
If +ipccommand+ is invoked incorrectly it complains to standard error and
exit{nbsp}100.  If it encounters a read or write error, +ipccommand+ complains
to standard error and exit{nbsp}111.  Otherwise, it exit{nbsp}0.
