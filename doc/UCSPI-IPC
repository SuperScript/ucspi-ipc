This document defines the IPC protocol for UCSPI-1996 tools. An IPC
client communicates with a IPC server on the same machine through a
local-domain stream socket. The descriptors passed to an UCSPI
application are copies of that socket, dup()ed from a single connect()
or accept().  On the server side, the remote effective user and group
IDs reflect the process that called connect().

[address] consists of one argument: [path].

A [path] is a file name associated with a local-domain socket.

The server sets up the following environment variables:

   PROTO: the string IPC
   IPCLOCALPATH: the local path identifying the local-domain socket
   IPCREMOTEPATH: the remote path identifying the local-domain socket
   IPCREMOTEEUID: the remote effective user ID
   IPCREMOTEEGID: the remote effective group ID

The client sets up the following environment variables:

   PROTO: the string IPC
   IPCLOCALPATH: the local path identifying the local-domain socket
