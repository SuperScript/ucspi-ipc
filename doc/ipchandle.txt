== NAME
ipchandle - template for preforking ipcserver

== DESCRIPTION 

The +ipchandle.c+ file provides a template for creating preforking
link:ipcserver.html[+ipcserver+]-like servers.  The concurrency option (+-c+)
sets the number of children that a ipchandle server forks upon startup.  The
default setting is{nbsp}40.  Each child process listens for requests on the
socket inherited from the parent process.

If any of its child processes exits, a ipchandle server forks a new child
process to replace the original.  When it receives SIGTERM, a ipchandle server
sends SIGTERM to each of its children, waits for them to exit, and then itself
exits.

Before handling an accepted request, a ipchandle server sets certain
link:ucspi-ipc-environ.html[environment variables], a la +ipcserver+.

=== Server Code
A ipchandle server invokes a +server+ subroutine for each request.  The
subroutine reads from the network on file descripto{nbsp}0 and writes to the
network on file descripto{nbsp}1:
!!!!
void server(int argc,char * const *argv)
!!!!
The arguments to +server+ are the command line arguments to the ipchandle
server that remain after option parsing.

The +server+ subroutine is called within a loop, with one iteration per
request.  It must release any resources allocated to handle a particular
request before returning to its caller.  This includes changes to the
environment.

=== Compiling A New ipchandle Server
Create a file +src/myserver.c+ that implements the +server+ subroutine.
Create a control file +src/myserver=x+ listing all necessary dependencies.
Then
!!!!
build myserver
!!!!

The ucspi-ipc package includes two example servers: +ipcprint+, and
link:ipcperl.html[+ipcperl+].

== OPTIONS

Each ipchandle server accepts all +ipcserver+ options, and in addition:

+-f !lockfile!+::
Lock +!lockfile!+ around calls to +accept+.

Utilize this option if your +accept+ system call suffers from the
thundering herd problem.
