== NAME
getpeereid - get effective user and group id of local domain socket peer

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
int getpeereid(int !s!,uid_t *!u!,gid_t *!g!);
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +getpeereid+ function stores the effective user and group IDs of the
peer on local domain socket +!s!+ in +!u!+ and +!g!+, respectively.  It
returns 0 if successful, and -1 if an error occurs, setting +errno+
appropriately.

When it accepts a connection, +ipcserver+ uses the effective user ID and
effective group ID of the process that called +connect+ to decide whether to
handle the connection or drop it immediately.  Therefore ucspi-ipc requires
operating system support for passing the client credentials to the server.
For discussions of various credential-passing mechanisms, see D.J. Bernstein's
http://cr.yp.to/docs/secureipc.html[Secure interprocess communication] and the
BugTraq mailing list thread stemming from
http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=1999-01-01&msg=19990106040754.18811.qmail@cr.yp.to[Wiping out setuid programs].

Programs in the ucspi-ipc package use +getpeereid+ to obtain client
credentials.  Unless your operating system supports an implementation of
+getpeereid+, you cannot use ucspi-ipc.

== Implementations
Recent Linux kernels that support +SO_PEERCRED+ with
+getsockopt+ provide sufficient basis for a getpeereid function.
Various systems offer a +gepeereid+ system call, including
http://www.openbsd.org[OpenBS{nbsp}3.0],
http://www.freebsd.org[FreeBS{nbsp}4.6], and
http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/index.html[AI{nbsp}5L].

Experimental operating system link:../patches/index.html[patches]
that add a +getpeereid+ system call are available for several BSD
variants.
