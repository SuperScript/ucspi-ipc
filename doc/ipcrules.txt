== NAME
ipcrules - compile rules for ipcserver

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipcrules !cdb! !tmp!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +ipcrules+ program reads rules from its standard input and writes them
into +!cdb!+ in a binary format suited for quick access by +ipcserver+.
The update is atomic and can be run while +ipcserver+ is running.   It first
writes the rules to +!tmp!+ and then moving +!tmp!+ on top of +!cdb!+.  If
+!tmp!+ already exists, it is destroyed.  The directories containing +!cdb!+
and +!tmp!+ must be writable to +ipcrules+, and must also be on the same
filesystem.

If there is a problem with the input or with +!tmp!+, +ipcrules+ complains and
leaves +!cdb!+ untouched.

=== Rule Format
A rule occupies one line.  A file containing rules may contain comments: lines
beginning with # are ignored.

Each rule contains an effective ID, a colon, and a list of instructions, with
no extra spaces.  When +ipcserver+ receives a connection from that userid, it
follows the instructions.

=== Effective IDs
The +ipcserver+ program looks for rules with various userids:

. +$IPCREMOTEEUID.$IPCREMOTEEGID+;
. +$IPCREMOTEEUID+;
. +.$IPCREMOTEEGID+;
. The empty string.

It uses the first matching rule it finds.

For example, here are some rules:
!!!!
1001.1010:first
1002:second
:third
.1010:fourth
!!!!

If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 5 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 10,
+ipcserver+ will follow the third instruction.

If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 1002, +ipcserver+ will follow the
second instruction.

If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 5 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 1010,
+ipcserver+ will follow the fourth instruction.

If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 1001 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 1010,
+ipcserver+ will follow the first instruction.

You can use link:ipcrulescheck.html[+ipcrulescheck+] to see how +ipcserver+
will interpret rules in +!cdb!+.

=== User Ranges
The +ipcrules+ program treats
!!!!
1001-1023:instructions
!!!!
as an abbreviation for the rules
!!!!
1001:instructions
1002:instructions
...
1023:instructions
!!!!

=== Instructions
The instructions in a rule must begin with either +allow+ or
+deny+.  An instruction beginning with +deny+ tells
+ipcserver+ to drop the connection without running any program.
For example, the rule
!!!!
:deny
!!!!
tells +ipcserver+ to drop any connection that is not handled by a more
specific rule.

The instruction may continue with some environment variables assignments, in
the form +var="x"+.  +ipcserver+ adds an environment variable +$var+ with
value +x+.  For example,
!!!!
1001:allow,ACCESS="special"
!!!!
adds an environment variable +$ACCESS+ with a value of +special+.  Any
repeated character may appear in place of the quote character:
!!!!
1001:allow,ACCESS=/special/
!!!!
and any number of variables assignments may appear in a single rule:
!!!!
1001:allow,ACCESS="special",SECRETWORD=/mudshark/
!!!!
