== NAME
ucspi-ipc-environ - environment variables for ipc servers and clients

== DESCRIPTION 
The following environment variables are set for subordinate programs under
servers and clients in ucspi-ipc:

+$PROTO+::
The string +IPC+.  Both +ipcserver+ and +ipcclient+ set this environment
variable.

+$IPCLOCALPATH+::
The file name associated with the local socket.  Both +ipcserver+ and
+ipcclient+ set this environment variable.

+$IPCREMOTEPATH+::
The path associated with the remote socket.  Only +ipcserver+ sets this
environment variable.  If the remote socket is not bound to a path, then this
environment variable is set, but empty.  Beware that +$IPCREMOTEPATH+ is under
the control of the remote user, and can contain arbitrary characters.

+$IPCREMOTEEUID+::
The effective user id of the client process that called +connect+, in decimal.
Only +ipcserver+ sets this environment variable.

+$IPCREMOTEEGID+::
The effective group id of the client process that called +connect+, in
decimal.  Only +ipcserver+ sets this environment variable.
