== NAME
ipcexec - handle ipc execution requests

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipcexec !cdb!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +ipcexec+ program reads a user ID +!USERID!+ and a program +!prog!+ from
file descriptor 0, and reads the remote user ID and group ID from the
environment variables +IPCREMOTEEUID+ and +IPCREMOTEEGID+.  If the rules in
+!cdb!+ permit the remote user to execute +!prog!+ as +!USERID!+, then
+ipcexec+ changes its effective user and group ID to match +!USERID!+, and
executes +!prog!+.

By default, +ipcexec+ redirects standard error to standard output before
executing +!prog!+.  If the +$IPCERROUT+ environment variable is set to
+0+, then +ipcexec+ does not redirect standard error before executing
+!prog!+.


If the rules in +!cdb!+ deny execution of the request, then +ipcexec+
silently exit{nbsp}100.

After processing the matching rule from +!cdb!+ and before executing the
request, +ipcexec+ checks the following environment variables:

+$IPCERROUT+::
If decimal nonzero, +ipcexec+ redirects standard error to standard output
before executing +!prog!+.

+$IPCUID+::
If set, then +ipcexec+ sets its effective user ID to +$IPCUID+ before
executing +!prog!+.  This environment variable setting overrides +!USERID!+.

+$IPCGID+::
If set, then +ipcexec+ sets its effective group ID to +$IPCGID+ before
executing +!prog!+.  This environment variable setting overrides +!USERID!+.
