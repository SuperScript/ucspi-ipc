== NAME
ipcexecrules - compile rules for ipcexec

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ipcexecrules !cdb! !tmp!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +ipcexecrules+ program reads rules from its standard input and writes them
into +!cdb!+ in a binary format suited for quick access by +ipcexec+.
The update is atomic and can be run while +ipcexec+ is running.  It first
writing the rules to +!tmp!+ and then moving +!tmp!+ on top of +!cdb!+.  If
+!tmp!+ already exists, it is destroyed.  The directories containing +!cdb!+
and +!tmp!+ must be writable to +ipcexecrules+, and must also be on the same
filesystem.

If there is a problem with the input or with +!tmp!+, +ipcexecrules+
complains and leaves +!cdb!+ untouched.

=== Rule Format
A rule occupies one line.  A file containing rules may also contain comments:
lines beginning with # are ignored.

Each rule contains a pattern, a colon, and a list of instructions, with no
extra spaces.  When +ipcexec+ receives a request, it follows the instructions
of the first matching pattern in +!cdb!+.

=== Patterns
The +ipcexec+ program looks for rules with various patterns:

. +$IPCREMOTEEUID.$IPCREMOTEEGID,!USERID!.!cmd!+;
. +$IPCREMOTEEUID,!USERID!.!cmd!+;
. +.$IPCREMOTEEGID,!USERID!.!cmd!+;
. +,!USERID!.!cmd!+;
. the empty string.

It uses the first matching rule it finds.

For example, here are some rules:
!!!!
1001.1010,0.echo:allow,first
1002,0.echo:allow,second
:deny,third
.1010,echo:allow,fourth
!!!!

Assume that +!USERID!+ is 0 and +!cmd!+ is +echo+.

* If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 5 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 10, +ipcexec+ will follow
the third instruction.

* If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 1002, +ipcexec+ will follow the second instruction.

* If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 5 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 1010, +ipcexec+ will follow
the fourth instruction.

* If +$IPCREMOTEEUID+ is 1001 and +$IPCREMOTEEGID+ is 1010, +ipcexec+ will
follow the first instruction.

You can use link:ipcexecrulescheck.html[+ipcexecrulescheck+] to see how
+ipcexec+ will interpret rules in +!cdb!+.

=== User Ranges
The +ipcexecrules+ program treats
!!!!
1001-1023,!USERID!.!cmd!:instructions
!!!!
as an abbreviation for the rules
!!!!
1001,!USERID!.!cmd!:instructions
1002,!USERID!.!cmd!:instructions
...
1023,!USERID!.!cmd!:instructions
!!!!

=== Instructions
The instructions in a rule must begin with either +allow+ or +deny+.  An
instruction beginning with +deny+ tells +ipcexec+ to exit without running any
program.  For example, the rule
!!!!
:deny
!!!!
tells +ipcexec+ to ignore any request that is not handled by a more specific
rule.

An instruction with +allow+ tells +ipcexec+ to execute the request.  It
executes +!cmd!+ with arguments also read from file descripto{nbsp}0.
Arguments are passed directly to http://cr.yp.to/lib/pathexec.html[+pathexec+]
without further interpretation.  If the matching rule instruction begins with
!!!!
allow="!path!"
!!!!
then +ipcexec+ executes +!path!+ instead of +!cmd!+, with the arguments
specified in the request.  Any repeated character may appear in place of the
quote character.

The instruction may continue with some environment variable assignments, in
the form +var="x"+.  +ipcexec+ adds an environment variable +$var+ with value
+x+.  For example,
!!!!
1001,0.echo:allow="/bin/echo",ACCESS="special"
!!!!
adds an environment variable +$ACCESS+ with a value of
+special+.  Any repeated character may appear in place of the
quote character:
!!!!
1001,0.echo:allow="/bin/echo",ACCESS=/special/
!!!!
and any number of variables assignments may appear in a single rule:
!!!!
1001,0.echo:allow="/bin/echo",ACCESS="special",SECRETWORD=/mudshark/
!!!!
